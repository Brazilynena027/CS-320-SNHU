How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  1. Understand the requirements- Ask yourself how the project will be used and what setting. What tye of project is this? Cloud based,front or back end. What industry will this project be deployed?
  2. Define software development process- there maybe best practices and standards to follow.
  3.Impose Software security with secure coding pratices- use secure coding tools and follow secure coding practices. 
  4. Impliment security checks- do security checks in increments throughout your development process. 
  5. Have a definition of done- This means having a clear process for defining the work being done from beginning to end. 
  6. Define acceptance criteria
  7. Automation for integration, security and final testing.
  8.Peer code reviews

  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  I interpret user needs by Involving the users in the design phase of the program. Get their vision of what they want the software to acomplish. Map out their requirements. Ask the users for feedback. 
  
How do I approach designing software?

  Have a clear and concise understanding of the users requirements. Depending on how large the design is, Using an agile design process would be more flexible where you would have teams involved in the design process. However, for smaller projects maybe an iterative design process would be best were you design in stages where you would build on the previous stages. In summary, I would say that it would depend on the requirements, size and complexity of the system which approach I would use.
